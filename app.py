         With the help of this web application, you will be able to get a forecast for your retail business. The program is designed for small and medium-sized businesses that already have a certain set of data about their sales and want to use it for analysis and forecasting.
          To do this, you need to take the following steps:
          1. Import the dataset
          2. Enter the forecast interval
          3. Familiarize yourself with data visualization
          4. Download the forecast

 This program will help you independently make the forecast you need
specifically for your business. It can be a forecast of income, expenses, profit or the amount of goods sold. In order to make a high-quality forecast, it is necessary to collect
a set of sales data in your business. And after that go through 4 steps in this web application to get a forecast based on your data.

The date column should be called ds and formatted in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD (Example: 2019-05-20).
