         With the help of this web application, you can forecast key healthcare metrics such as patient admissions, drug sales, or disease outbreak trends. Designed for healthcare professionals, institutions, or researchers with data sets ready for analysis and forecasting, the steps include:
          1. Importing the dataset
          2. Specifying the forecast interval
          3. Analyzing data visualizations
          4. Downloading the forecast

This application aids in crafting precise forecasts tailored to healthcare. Whether you're forecasting patient admissions, medical equipment demand, or disease trends, accurate data is the foundation. Start by gathering a coherent set of data for your healthcare institution or research. Afterward, follow the 4 steps in this web application to derive a forecast rooted in your data.
